Note: The leaderboard has been updated for area@infinity.  This script has not been updated to handle that yet.  I hope to soonâ„¢, but until then, it's not working. 



This tool checks all your Opus Magnum solutions, compares them again the leaderboard, and reports which are pareto and should be submitted.
If you're on Windows, it will automatically find your save folder.  Otherwise, you'll need to add it manually in hunt.py::root_folders

It's not very pretty, but it works. If people like this and I'm not too lazy, I might throw a better UI on it.

To use run hunt.py and enter the number on the menu to do the action

1. Rescan
    Counts up how many new files there are that need to be check/recheck
2. Process
    Gathers stats on new/updated files and stores them a database.
3. Mismatch
    Reports which solution parsed scores don't match their computed scores
4. Duplicate Scores
    Reports when multiple solutions have identical scores.  If one is pareto, they'd both get reported and I find this annoying.
5. Duplicate Names
    Reports when multiple solutions have the same name.  It can be a bit confusing to find the solution you're looking for if they have the same name.
6. Refresh leaderboard cache
    After processing local files, this action checks the online leaderboard.  It will only check the leaderboards for which you currently have solutions that might be pareto.
7. Force leaderboard cache
    The previous version only updates the cache if the cache is older than any local modifications. If it's been a while and you think the leaderboard has new submissions that out pareto yours, use this option.
8. Pareto
    Reports all your solutions which would be pareto if submitted to the global leaderboard.  Be sure to run #6 first
9. Just records
    Reports all your pareto solutions which would win a tracked category.  Ties beyond the hard defined metrics default to the existing solutions.
